        <ul>
            <li>Rani Lakshmibai was born as Manikarnika Tambe on 18 November 1835, in a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family
                in Kashi (now Varanasi).</li>
            <li>Rani Lakshmibai was educated at home and could read and write.
                She was also trained in martial arts, shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba.
                She has three horse- Sarangi, Pavan and Badal.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the year 1842, she got married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar.
                On getting married, she was given the name Lakshmi Bai.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the year 1851, she gave birth to a son. Unfortunately, the child did not survive more than four
                months.
            </li>
            <li>In the year 1853, Gangadhar Rao fell sick and became very weak. So, the couple decided to adopt a child.
                To ensure that the British do not raise an issue over the adoption, Lakshmibai got this adoption
                witnessed by the local British representatives.
                On 21st November 1853, Maharaja Gangadhar Rao died.</li>
            <li>In November 1853, after the death of Maharaja, British East India Company, applied Doctrine of Lapse,
                under the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. Under this policy, Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was
                rejected as he was adopted son of Maharaja and Rani.</li>
            <li>On 7th March 1854, the British issued a gazette dissolving the State of Jhansi.</li>
            <li>On May 10, 1857, while she was assembling an army, the Sepoy (soldier) Mutiny of India, (India’s first
                war of independence) started in Meerut.</li>
            <li>Along with Meerut, Delhi and Bareilly, Jhansi also was freed from the British rule. Three years after
                Jhansi was freed, Rani Lakshmibai took over the control of Jhansi and she made preparations to defend
                Jhansi from the likely attack by the British.</li>
            <li>On 20th March 1858, Sir Huge encamped with his army sent a message to her that she should surrender; but
                rather than surrendering, she stood on the rampart of her fort motivating her army to fight with the
                British. The battle started. Jhansi canons started routing the British. Even after 3 days of continuous
                firing, the fort of Jhansi could not be attacked; therefore, Sir Hugh decided to adopt the path of
                treachery. Finally, on 3rd April 1858, the army of Sir Hugh Rose entered Jhansi.</li>
            <li> with her troupe of trusted 200 cavalry, she tied her 12 year old son Damodar Rao to her back and
                raising
                the slogan of ‘Jai Shankar’ left her fort.</li>
            <li>On 24th May 1858,Rani Lakshmibai won over Gwalior and handed it over to Peshava Nana Sahib.</li>
            <li>On 18th June, the British attacked Gwalior from all sides. She decided to break the enemy front and go
                out rather than surrendering.</li>
            <li>She died in June 18, 1858, Kotah-ki-Serai, near Gwalior</li>
